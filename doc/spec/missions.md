# Issue-Backed Missions

Status: V1 product contract for the first Missions slice
Date: 2026-04-17

## Product Contract

A Mission is a managed execution mode over the existing Paperclip control plane. It is not a second task system, a chat surface, or a new agent runtime. A Mission is anchored by a company-scoped issue and uses normal issue documents, child issues, blockers, heartbeat runs, approvals, activity logs, work products, attachments, costs, and budget hard-stops.

The mission issue is the source of truth for the user outcome and shared state. Child issues remain the source of truth for execution. Parentage explains structure; explicit blockers encode dependencies. Agents still use checkout semantics, single-assignee ownership, comments, and heartbeat runs. Validators judge outcomes in fresh runs and do not patch code directly.

## Required Documents

Mission shared state is stored as issue documents on the mission issue. Required stable keys are:

- `plan`: human-readable implementation plan.
- `mission-brief`: goal, constraints, assumptions, scope, non-goals, stakeholders, and current status.
- `validation-contract`: finite testable assertions that define success before feature decomposition.
- `features`: feature and milestone list that claims validation assertions.
- `worker-guidelines`: role boundaries, testing expectations, workspace rules, and forbidden actions.
- `services`: app commands, preview URLs, test accounts, seeded data, environment needs, and setup costs.
- `knowledge-base`: concise discoveries future workers or validators need.
- `decision-log`: orchestrator decisions, waivers, and rationale.

Generated document keys are:

- `validation-report-round-N`, where `N` starts at 1.
- `milestone-summary-slug`, where `slug` is a lowercase document-key-safe milestone slug.
- `mission-final-report`.

MVP documents are markdown at the storage layer. Structured documents should embed JSON or YAML that conforms to the shared validators in `packages/shared/src/validators/mission.ts` when server code needs machine-readable parsing.

## Validation Assertions

The validation contract must exist before decomposition. Each assertion is finite, behavior-focused, and externally testable where possible.

Canonical fields:

- `id`: stable ID such as `VAL-MISSION-001`.
- `title`: short behavior name.
- `user_value`: why the assertion matters.
- `scope`: product area or workflow.
- `setup`: required data, server state, authentication, or project state.
- `steps`: ordered validator actions.
- `oracle`: pass/fail rule.
- `tooling`: required tooling such as `unit_test`, `api_call`, `browser`, `screenshot`, `log_inspection`, `code_review`, `cli_command`, `manual_review`, or `other`.
- `evidence`: required artifacts, with kind, description, and whether each is required.
- `claimed_by`: feature IDs expected to satisfy it.
- `status`: `unclaimed`, `claimed`, `passing`, `failing`, `blocked`, or `waived`.

## Features

The `features` document groups feature specs by milestone. Original features must claim at least one validation assertion. Fix features must reference a source finding.

Canonical feature fields:

- `id`: stable ID such as `FEAT-MISSION-001`.
- `title`: concise feature name.
- `kind`: `original` or `fix`.
- `summary`: bounded implementation scope.
- `acceptance_criteria`: concrete completion checks.
- `claimed_assertion_ids`: validation assertion IDs this feature is intended to satisfy.
- `status`: `planned`, `in_progress`, `implemented`, `validating`, `accepted`, `blocked`, or `cancelled`.
- `source_finding_id`: required for fix features.

Canonical milestone fields:

- `id`: stable ID such as `MILESTONE-MISSION-001`.
- `title`: milestone name.
- `summary`: why the group exists.
- `features`: non-empty feature list.

## Findings

Validators post structured findings so the orchestrator can create bounded fix issues or waivers.

Canonical fields:

- `id`: stable ID such as `FINDING-MISSION-001`.
- `severity`: `blocking`, `non_blocking`, or `suggestion`.
- `assertion_id`: related validation assertion, required for blocking findings.
- `title`: concise issue.
- `evidence`: links, attachments, command output references, screenshots, or work products.
- `repro_steps`: how to observe the issue.
- `expected`: expected behavior.
- `actual`: observed behavior.
- `suspected_area`: optional file, module, route, or workflow.
- `recommended_fix_scope`: small fix proposal; required when status is `fix_created`.
- `status`: `open`, `fix_created`, `waived`, or `resolved`.

## State Derivation

MVP mission state is derived from issue and document state rather than a new table.

- `cancelled`: mission issue is `cancelled`.
- `paused`: budget or operator policy has paused scheduling.
- `blocked`: mission issue is `blocked` or unresolved blocking findings exist.
- `completed`: mission issue is `done` and `mission-final-report` exists.
- `draft`: `mission-brief` or `validation-contract` is missing.
- `ready_for_approval`: required planning documents exist and approval is required before scheduling.
- `planning`: validation contract exists but feature decomposition is missing or no active work is scheduled yet.
- `fixing`: active fix issues exist.
- `validating`: active validation issues exist.
- `running`: active original feature issues exist.

Issue status remains the execution status. Mission state is a projection for summaries and UI.

## Governance Rules

- Mission routes and services must enforce company access.
- Mission scheduling must not bypass issue checkout, single-assignee ownership, activity logging, approval gates, or budget hard-stops.
- Blockers are first-class issue relationships, not free-text comments.
- Work products and attachments hold validation evidence.
- Board/operator users can pause, cancel, approve, or inspect through normal issue and approval surfaces.
- Validators report findings; orchestrators decide fix issues, waivers, and final recommendation.
